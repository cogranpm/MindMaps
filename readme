a react front end only app based on typescript and parcel for the build

using parcel due to simple support for web workers

scripts:
npm run start
npm run build

typecheck:
run tsc in the root directory
: note this fails after adding web worker as needed to change moduleResolution to esnext to support import.meta.url
build and stuff seems to still work so it's under investigation

preview prod build:
run this in the dist directory after doing a build: python -m http.server
